<h1>Pokemon simulations</h1>
<p>Hello everybody. I really do hope you enjoy this project. <br><i>Just as a quick note, if anything (abilities, held items etc.) doesn't work, please let me know. (if you can fix the code then even better)</i></p>

<h2>Project description</h2>
I started this project on June 8th 2024 as a way to simulate any pokemon battle I wanted. I wished to figure out questions like: <br><br>
<b>"Which pokemon is the strongest?"</b> <br>
<b>"Who is the strongest trainer?"</b> <br>
<b>"What is the strongest pokemon of 𝑥 type?"</b><br> <br>
So like any <i>normal</i> person I decided to attempt to recreate the entire pokemon battle mechancic. Yes. That's right. I also wanted this project
to be also like a framework, where anybody with minimal coding experience (just the fundamentals) could make their own simulations and figure out any questions they may have.

<h2>What is included:</h2>
Inside this project, you will find: <br>

<ul>
  <li><b>Files with every pokemon and their information (that is relevant to battle mechanics e.g. no dex number or description)</b> 🐇</li>
  <li><b>Every single move with their primary & secondary effects programmed to work in battle with a simple function call to use the move¹</b> ⚔️</li>
  <li><b>Every single ability fully functional and working­¹</b> 🛡️</li>
  <li><b>Every single held item programmed to work¹</b> 🍓</li>
  <li><b>All natures & types working</b> 🔥</li>
  <li><b>Damage calculators</b> 💥</li>
  <li><b>Pokemon teams of 6 (for battle simulations) with an AI²</b> 🆚</li>
  <li><b>Option to save teams and import/export teams to and from pokemon showdown</b> 💾</li>
</ul>
¹ They are limited to only GEN 9 abilities, moves and held items as if an item has been denied usage in GEN 9, there clearly must be reason <br>
² The AI won't be super sophisticated to make you lose (👀 you know what, maybe ...) yet it won't be as simple as just select a random move.

<i>if I need to add anything (which I can but not necessary just yet) I will update this, I just wanted to get my message accross to why I made this project.</i>
